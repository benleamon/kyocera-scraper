# Kyocera Dome Webscraper
This webscraper will add Google Calendar events for events happening at Osaka's Kyocera Dome. Hopefully, this means you will be less likely to end up on a crowded train, or in a packed supermarket. 

## Getting Started: 
Create a new Google Apps Script, add the code, making sure to update the relevant URLs for your calendar. 

Create a trigger to run the script whenever you want. I have it set to run at the begining of the month. 

Alternately, just use my calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZTIwYjBiZjg2YWEzYmM3MDllMjJlMDc1ZGMyOWU5MjE2M2RlOWIxODZiOWQ1MjI5YjU5YjhmM2ZlYzc3ZDc5M0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
